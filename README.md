## 🔧 Current Projects

- **CalCore-ISA**: A modular instruction set and simulation platform for structured health data processing.  
  → Exploring how domain-specific ISAs can enhance edge AI applications.

- **gLayout (UMich EDA Lab)**: Graph-based rule modeling for automated layout generation and PDK validation.  
  → Working on rule-driven cell factory generation and DRC-aware placement.

- **OpenVINO AI Deployment (Intel AI PC project)**:  
  → Deployed diffusion/text-to-image generative models using OpenVINO Runtime on low-power platforms.
